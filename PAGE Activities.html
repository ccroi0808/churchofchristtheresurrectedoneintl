It unites the three core elements of the Consolidation stage in the G12 VIsion: Pre-Encounter, Encounter and Post-Encounter. Discipleship can be used by leaders to successfully guide new believers through the foundations for their growing faith, ensuring that they are prepared for a transformative, face-to-face encounter with God. Attending Discipleship's Journey enables people to experience the real impact of an Encounter, and equips them to be able to go on to reach their full potential as a leader through the NEW SCHOOL OF LEADERS.<br><br>

			<p class="pOverview">One of the greatest ways a church can grow is through vibrant small group ministry!  Take the time to craft a letter of invitation to the various groups and watch your church grow! Small groups help us to apply what we learn on a Sunday morning to our relationships with our roommates or our kids. They help us to see the work God has given us to do in our office, in our homes, or in our classrooms as important to him. Small groups create an active learning environment where we can bring our questions, thoughts, and learn from and with others. They are places that we join together and serve in ways that are far more powerful than what we can do on our own. Following King Jesus is a group project. It’s not something we can do on our own. One of the best ways for Christians, especially those who are part of a big church like The Crossing, to do so is by joining a small group.<br>

			<p class="pOverview">In Depth is our weekly activity every thursday via google meet. in this activity you will be given the opportunity to ask questions in the bible that are confusing you. participating in this activity will help you expand your knowledge of the bible. Let’s get rid of the events that are holding our church back from growing. Let’s find the events that are thriving and add fuel to the proverbial fire. Let’s get rid of the old and bring in the new, and let’s start today. <br>
			<br><br>
	Relationships - This is a great theme for a series of small group discussions that can include not just dating, but investing in healthy, safe friendships and getting along with parents and siblings.<br>
	<br>

	Biblical Fathering/Leading - Matthew 20:26-27 reminds us that positioning as a father takes great humility (or any position of authority for those without children). A study of Philippians 2:5-8 positions your small group to mine the truths of servant-leadership.<br>
	<br>

	Discovering the Will of God - Proverbs 2:5 says the key to knowledge is fear of God. When we know God, we have a clearer understanding of his awe-worthiness, and have a deeper insight into his will for us. Reading Proverbs 2 — while highlighting ways you are instructed to search for God and his truth — will help your small group grow in this concept together.<br>
