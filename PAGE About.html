			<p class="pOverviews"><font color="ec7f09">CCROI </font>Church of Christ the Resurrected One Intl. is a family established in the faith of the resurrection of Christ, committed in the transformation of lives through the works of God. We desire to be a channel of blessings and lay open the 
			miracles of God to His son and daughters. <br><br>

			Translating this to our current situation, Christ who gave His life for us, freed us from the slavery of sin and yet we chose to serve Him out of that freedom. Besides giving His own personal life, Jesus serves the people around Him, most especially His disciples. One of the memorable instances that He showed what serving is, was when He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around Him. Truly it is an example given to us that we should do, just as how Jesus did it. Following the footsteps of Christ, who demonstrates true meaning of serving.</p>

			<p class="pOverview">It started with a dream for the young people and the dream will continue up to the next generations. CCROI will not stop serving God, His people and other churches here in the Philippines and even to other countries. There can be successes along the way but all of these are considered done and will remain in the past. Jesus will always be important and worth more than all of these accomplishments. DFCWHM will focus on what is ahead for there are greater and bright things not just for Doulos but to the whole churches in the Philippines and around the globe. Following the bible as the final authority, Doulos for Christ, together with the Ballano family will always bring back all the glory and honor to Name above all names, and that is Jesus. Doulos will always keep the heart of a bondservant. Doulos is to serve!<br><br>

			We Doulos for Christ live up to our name, "bondservant". Embracing our calling as agents of change and ambassadors, we keep the heart of a servant to share the joy of salvation. It is our privilege to be used in sharing the good news and help others find their way back to God through God's grace and power. We will keep our feet to stand on the truth of loving God and loving His people. This is why we believe that having an intimate relationship with Christ will make a huge impact in the lives of many<br><br>

			Together with Bishop Oriel M. Ballano and Pastora Geraldine Ballano as the head pastors of Doulos for Christ, we will not stop and we will never retire in the calling that God gave to us. This will impact not just the current generation but up until the future generations that will come out in us. We will always stand for our nation for we know that the Philippines will remain as the Pearl of the Orient, a nation that will glorify and banner the name of Jesus. Nation transformation is on its way and we as followers of Christ will focus on serving the One True King and His people. The Philippines will always be for Jesus!<br>

And as they continue to journey and deepen their relationship with God, it is our great privilege to help them.  </p>

Experiencing the genuine love of God through His son Jesus Christ, God showed the purest and truest form of what love is all about. We will continue to love the Lord with all of our heart, soul and mind for we are all created in His own likeness with the design and purpose to love God and His people.<br><br><br></p>
